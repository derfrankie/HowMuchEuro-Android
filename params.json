{"name":"HowMuchEuro? Android","body":"### How much Euro?\r\nHow much Euro? is the first sales tax aware currency converter. In the US and Canada prices shown in stores are mostly without sales tax. This messes up the result of any normal currency converter.\r\nNot “How much Euro?”, which calculates the tax and adds it before converting dollars to euros. This helps travellers, exchange students and other visitors to the US and Canada to understand quickly how much an item costs in Euro just like they are used to in their home country.\r\n\r\nMore information: http://www.frankie.bz/v3/go/howmucheuropost/\r\nHelp me translate this App: http://www.getlocalization.com/howmucheuro/\r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n```\r\n0.1  * First Design Study\r\n0.2  * First workable Version\r\n0.3  + Local Storage\r\n     + Get actual rates from http://josscrowcroft.github.com/open-exchange-rates/\r\n1.0  * First released Version\r\n1.1  + Added localization for German\r\n     + Added designs for iPhone, iPad and Android Tablets\r\n     + Made ready for running on multiple OS - iOS added\r\n     + New UI elements (for settings page)\r\n\t + Minor visual improvements\r\n1.2  + Added languages: Italian, French, Spanish, Portugese\r\n     # Fixed Visual resize issues\r\n     # Fixed some previous translations\r\n```\r\n\r\nCopyright 2012 Frank Neulichedl\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
